# Introduction to SymPy ‚Äì Lab 3

This notebook introduces symbolic computation using Python‚Äôs `sympy` library. It demonstrates how to manipulate algebraic expressions, solve equations, and perform calculus operations symbolically. The code is organized in a single Jupyter Notebook: `lab3_sympy_lusterio.ipynb`.

## üìÅ Notebook Overview

### Symbolic Computation with SymPy
- Defines symbolic variables and expressions
- Performs algebraic operations: simplify, expand, factor
- Computes derivatives and integrals
- Solves algebraic and trigonometric equations symbolically

### Practice Activities
- Hands-on examples for exploring `sympy` functions
- Encourages step-by-step symbolic reasoning

## üìå Goal
- Learn how to use the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics in Python
- Apply mathematical thinking to automate solving, simplifying, and analyzing expressions and equations
