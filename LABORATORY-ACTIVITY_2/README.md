# Data Cleaning and Analysis using Titanic dataset ‚Äì Lab 2

This notebook builds on Lab 1 by enhancing preprocessing steps and comparing multiple classification models for better prediction of Titanic passenger survival. The code is organized in a single Jupyter Notebook: `lab2_titanic_Lusterio.ipynb`.

## üìÅ Notebook Overview

### Data Preprocessing and Encoding
- Refines missing data handling and drops irrelevant columns
- Uses `OneHotEncoder` to handle categorical variables more effectively
- Scales and prepares data for machine learning

### Model Building and Evaluation
- Implements and compares Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Splits the dataset using `train_test_split`
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy score and classification report

## üìå Goal
- Apply and deepen understanding of the four pillars of computational thinking: **Decomposition**, **Pattern Recognition**, **Abstraction**, and **Algorithm Design**
- Analyze the Titanic dataset to identify key insights and stories of the data.
